Keep in mind that scripts inside the /etc/cron.* folders are not allowed to have a dot in the filename, otherwise those will be ignored.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a working mail configuration, I recommend exim4 which is easily set up in a few minutes with standard settings.</description></item></channel></rss>
