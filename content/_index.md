# Servus!

My name is Tam치s G치l, I am an **astroparticle physicist** and working at Erlangen Centre for Astroparticle Physics ([**ECAP**](https://ecap.nat.fau.de/)).
I currently develop online monitoring and live reconstruction algorithms for the [**KM3NeT**](https://www.km3net.org) neutrino telescopes and maintain the IT services of KM3NeT and ECAP. My **DevOps** engineering skills include **Docker** (+Swarm), **GitLab** CI/CD, **Jenkins**, **Xen**, **OpenVZ** and more than two decades of experience with **Linux** and **BSD** as **system administrator**.

I spend most of my time with science (astroparticle physics), coding ([**Julia**](https://www.julialang.org), Python, ...) and electronics (both analog/digital); the rest preferably off the road with one of my **motorbikes**. I have an obsession to **repair things** and keep them alive as long as possible, no matter if it requires a gearbox restoration of my **BMW R1100 GS** or replacing a dead 0201 SMD capacitor on a MacBook logicboard.

Occasionally I publish some content on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGGBifIs6mZje8eWI3Q34Dg): electronics repair videos, live coding and some other tiny video projects for fun, but I plan to start a series of **DIY** videos not only about electronics but also about **modular synthesizers**, which I am currently exploring. This is a topic I really enjoy and looking forward to gain and share experience.
