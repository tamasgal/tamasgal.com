# Servus

My name is Tamás Gál, I am a physicist and working on my PhD at the Erlangen Centre for Astroparticle Physics [**ECAP**](https://ecap.nat.fau.de/).
I currently develop online monitoring and live reconstruction algorithms for the [**KM3NeT**](https://www.km3net.org) neutrino telescopes.
In addition to that, I work as a freelancer programmer and graphic designer.

You can find me on [**twitter**](https://twitter.com/tamasgal) or [**GitHub**](https://github.com/tamasgal).
