The schematics are based on the 1161 Buffered Multiple from Sam Battle (aka LOOK MUM NO COMPUTER).
Introduction Alright, this is a very simple yet absolutely essential module in a modular synth: the buffered multiple.
Why is it called multiple? Because it&amp;rsquo;s makes multiple signals out of one by replicating it. What does buffered mean? In contrast to a passive multiple which is basically a cable distributor, a buffered multiple not only replicates the signal on each of its outputs, it also buffers them in the sense that it decouples it from the original current source.</description></item></channel></rss>
